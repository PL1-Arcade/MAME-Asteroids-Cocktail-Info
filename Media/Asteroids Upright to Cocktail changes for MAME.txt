Here are three suggested corrections to Asteroids/Asteroids Deluxe Cocktail, Upright, and Cabaret machine configurations in MAME.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Asteroids machine configuration missing Player 2 controls connections for Cocktail.

    Steps to reproduce:

---- Theory for why these changes are needed. ----
Asteroids Cocktail machines do have both P1 and P2 controls tied to the same five PCB inputs (P20 Pins 10, 14, 15, S and T -- blue on schematic), BUT the ground does not come from P20 Pin Z like it does in the Upright wiring harness.
- The ground (or 5v) for P1 controls comes from P20 Pin J. (purple on schematic)
- The ground (or 5v) for P2 controls comes from P20 Pin 7. (red on schematic)
- The state of Pin J will be the opposite of Pin 7 because Q14 doesn't have an  inverting amplifier that feeds it, but Q15 does.  Pin 7 then connects to the Video Inverter circuit via Pin 19.

P1 controls +  Start 1 + Start 2 get their ground from the collector of Q14 which is connected to P20 Pin J. (purple)
- When P1 is playing, Pin 7 will be at 5v (see Video Inverter note) and Pin J will be at 0v so when you press one of P1's buttons, 0v (ground) is applied to the associated PCB input which triggers that input.
- When P2 is playing, Pin 7 will be at 0v and Pin J will be at 5v so when you press one of P1's buttons, 5v is applied to the associated PCB input which does not trigger the input.
- The five P1 1N100 blocking diodes (orange box) and five more for P2 (not shown on schematic) keep ground from feeding back through the buttons when P1 and P2 press the same button at the same time. (i.e. Pin 7 will be shorted to Pin J)

P2 controls get their ground from the collector of Q15 which is connected to P20 Pin 7. (red)
- When P1 is playing, Pin 7 will be at 5v and Pin J will be at 0v so when you press one of P2's buttons, 5v is applied to the associated PCB input which does not trigger the input.
- When P2 is playing, Pin 7 will be at 0v and Pin J will be at 5v so when you press one of P2's buttons, ground (0v) is applied to the associated PCB input which triggers that input.

2. Asteroids Deluxe machine configuration missing Player 2 controls connections for Cocktail.

    Steps to reproduce:
Open MAME "Input assignments (this system)" menu.   There are no P2 inputs shown.

    Additional information:
Same basic changes as Asteroids Cocktail except that ground for Start 1 and Start 2 stays on P20 Pin Z.

3. Asteroids Deluxe current machine configuration option "Upright" is actually the "Cabaret" configuration for video because "Upright" cabs had a mirror.  This requires inverted X-axis video so the reflection of the monitor is in the correct orientation.

If you choose to leave this as-is to avoid false "bug" reports about reversed text, I'm pretty sure users can reverse the X-axis in MAME to use it in an original mirror cab, but maybe you could add a note somewhere in the source code referring to the related info on "4 Asteroids Deluxe Cocktail Schematic.png".

https://www.arcade-museum.com/manuals-videogames/A/AstDlx-Cabaret.pdf (page 10)

    Additional information:
- The Cocktail cab machine config is already good for video.
-- It inverts both X-axis and Y-axis for P2's turn. (P20 Pins 7, 16, and 19 are all connected)

- The Upright cab had a mirror so X-axis invert (P20 Pin 19) should be tied to ground. (P20 Pin Z)  When the player looks at the mirror, the reflection of the monitor will be in the correct orientation.

- The Cabaret had no mirror so it had neither axis inverted.  (P20 Pin 7 isn't connected to Pins 16 or 19)

    Suggested fix:
Rename "Upright" config option to "Cabaret" and/or add "Upright (Mirror)" or something similar as a machine config option?
- The problem with keeping the config name "Upright" is that people who are not using a mirrored cabinet (i.e. almost everyone) will complain that the text is backward.
